## 8. Development and Deployment

### 8.1 Local Development
- Use npm as the package manager
- Set up a local development environment with the following scripts:
  - `npm run dev`: Start the development server
  - `npm run build`: Build the production-ready application
  - `npm run start`: Start the production server
  - `npm run lint`: Run ESLint for code quality checks
  - `npm run test`: Run Jest for unit and integration tests

### 8.2 GitHub Repository Structure
- `/src`: Source code directory
  - `/components`: React components
  - `/lib`: Utility functions and data processing
  - `/styles`: CSS and style-related files
- `/public`: Static assets
- `/pages`: Next.js pages
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts

- Set up a custom domain if required
- Update `next.config.js` to include:
  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    basePath: process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS ? '/yemen-market-analysis-dashboard' : '',
    assetPrefix: process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS ? '/yemen-market-analysis-dashboard/' : '',
  }
  ```

### 8.4 GitHub Actions for Automated Deployment
- Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file with the following structure:
  ```yaml
  name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main

  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
          with:
            node-version: '14'
        - run: npm ci
        - run: npm run build
        - run: npm run export
        - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

          with:
            github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            publish_dir: ./out
  ```

### 8.5 Environment Variables
- Use `.env.local` for local development
- Set up GitHub Secrets for any sensitive information needed in the deployment process

### 8.6 Continuous Integration
