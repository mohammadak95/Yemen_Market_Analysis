**Methodology**

The Yemen Market Analysis project employs a comprehensive methodological framework that integrates advanced econometric and spatial analysis techniques to examine the influence of conflict intensity on commodity prices across different regions of Yemen. A key innovation in this project is the development of a **Time-Variant Market Integration Index (TV-MII)**, which quantifies the dynamic degree of market integration over time. This index captures fluctuations in market integration levels due to factors such as conflict intensity, policy changes, and other exogenous shocks, providing valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders.

This section delineates the systematic approach undertaken, encompassing data preprocessing, econometric modeling, spatial analysis, the construction of the TV-MII, and data preparation for visualization. The methodology leverages robust statistical models, spatial econometric techniques, and parallel processing to ensure rigorous and scalable analyses.

### **1. Data Collection and Preprocessing**

#### **1.1. Data Loading**

The analysis begins with the acquisition of spatial and temporal data encapsulated in GeoJSON files. The primary dataset, `unified_data.geojson`, contains detailed records of commodity prices, conflict intensity, and other relevant variables across multiple regions and time periods in Yemen.

- **Loading Mechanism:** Utilizes GeoPandas to read GeoJSON files, ensuring efficient handling of geospatial data.

  ```python
  import geopandas as gpd
  gdf = gpd.read_file('unified_data.geojson')
  ```

- **Configuration Management:** Employs a YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`) to manage file paths, directories, and analysis parameters, promoting flexibility and scalability.

#### **1.2. Data Cleaning and Transformation**

- **Duplicate Removal:** Eliminates duplicate records to maintain data integrity.

  ```python
  gdf.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
  ```

- **Missing Values Handling:** Addresses missing values through imputation strategies, such as replacing with median values, to prevent skewed analyses.

  ```python
  from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
  imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')
  gdf['usdprice'] = imputer.fit_transform(gdf[['usdprice']])
  ```

- **Date Processing:** Converts date columns to datetime objects to facilitate time-series analyses.

  ```python
  gdf['date'] = pd.to_datetime(gdf['date'], errors='coerce')
  ```

- **Categorical Data Encoding:** Transforms categorical variables (e.g., commodity, exchange_rate_regime) into suitable formats for modeling, including the creation of dummy variables.

  ```python
  gdf = pd.get_dummies(gdf, columns=['exchange_rate_regime'], drop_first=True)
  ```

- **Regime Unification:** Consolidates specified exchange rate regimes into a unified category (`unified`) to streamline analyses across different economic conditions.

  ```python
  gdf.loc[gdf['exchange_rate_regime'].isin(['north', 'south']), 'exchange_rate_regime'] = 'unified'
  ```

#### **1.3. Data Resampling and Alignment**

- **Frequency Alignment:** Resamples the dataset to a consistent temporal frequency (e.g., monthly) to ensure uniformity across time-series analyses.

  ```python
  gdf.set_index('date', inplace=True)
  gdf = gdf.groupby('region_id').resample('M').mean().reset_index()
  ```

- **Grouping:** Aggregates data by commodity and exchange_rate_regime to facilitate targeted analyses within specific market conditions.

  ```python
  grouped_data = gdf.groupby(['commodity', 'exchange_rate_regime'])
  ```

### **2. Econometric Modeling**

The project integrates multiple econometric models to dissect the relationship between conflict intensity and commodity prices, as well as to construct the Time-Variant Market Integration Index.

#### **2.1. Time-Variant Market Integration Index (TV-MII)**

**Objective:** Quantify the dynamic degree of market integration across different regions over time.

**Methodological Approach:**

##### **a. Price Differential Calculation**

- **Compute Log Price Differentials between Market Pairs:**

  \[
  \text{Price Differential}_{ijt} = \ln(P_{it}) - \ln(P_{jt})
  \]

  Where:
  - \( P_{it} \) and \( P_{jt} \) are the prices of the same commodity in regions \( i \) and \( j \) at time \( t \).

##### **b. Rolling Correlation Analysis**

- **Compute Rolling Correlations of Price Changes:**

  \[
  \text{Correlation}_{ijt} = \text{Corr}(\Delta \ln P_{it}, \Delta \ln P_{jt}) \text{ over window } [t - w, t]
  \]

  Where:
  - \( \Delta \ln P_{it} \) is the log price change in region \( i \) at time \( t \).
  - \( w \) is the window size (e.g., 12 months).

- **Interpretation:** Higher correlations indicate stronger market integration during the window.

##### **c. Time-Varying Coefficient Models**

- **Employ State-Space Models or Kalman Filter to Estimate Time-Varying Parameters:**

  \[
  \text{Price Differential}_{ijt} = \beta_t + \epsilon_t
  \]
  \[
  \beta_t = \beta_{t-1} + \eta_t
  \]

  Where:
  - \( \beta_t \) captures the degree of integration at time \( t \).
  - \( \epsilon_t \) and \( \eta_t \) are error terms representing observation and state noise, respectively.

- **Estimation:** Use Kalman filtering techniques to estimate \( \beta_t \) recursively over time.

##### **d. Index Construction**

- **Normalization:**

  - Scale the estimated parameters to a 0â€“1 range to facilitate comparison and interpretation.

  \[
  \text{TV-MII}_{ijt} = \frac{\beta_t - \min(\beta)}{\max(\beta) - \min(\beta)}
  \]

- **Aggregation:**

  - If analyzing multiple commodities or market pairs, aggregate the indices using weighted averages based on trade volumes or market sizes.

##### **e. Incorporating Exogenous Variables**

- **Conflict Intensity as a Moderator:**

  - Include interaction terms between conflict intensity and price differentials in the model to assess the impact of conflict on market integration.

  \[
  \text{Price Differential}_{ijt} = \beta_t + \gamma_t \times \text{Conflict Intensity}_{ijt} + \epsilon_t
  \]

  - Estimate time-varying coefficients \( \gamma_t \) to capture the changing influence of conflict intensity.

##### **f. Visualization and Analysis**

- **Time Series Plots:** Visualize the TV-MII over time for different market pairs to observe trends and shifts.

- **Spatial Plots:** Map the TV-MII geographically to identify regional patterns and areas of high or low integration.

---

#### **2.2. Error Correction Model (ECM)**

**Purpose:** Capture both short-term dynamics and long-term equilibrium relationships between commodity prices and conflict intensity.

##### **Model Specification**

- **Vector Error Correction Model (VECM):**

  \[
  \Delta \mathbf{y}_t = \Pi \mathbf{y}_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \Gamma_i \Delta \mathbf{y}_{t-i} + \Phi \mathbf{x}_t + \epsilon_t
  \]

  Where:
  - \( \Delta \) denotes the first difference operator.
  - \( \mathbf{y}_t \) is a vector of endogenous variables (e.g., commodity prices).
  - \( \Pi \) captures the long-term equilibrium relationships.
  - \( \Gamma_i \) are short-term adjustment coefficients.
  - \( \mathbf{x}_t \) represents exogenous variables (e.g., conflict intensity).
  - \( \epsilon_t \) is the error term.

##### **Stationarity and Cointegration Tests**

- **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test:** To check for unit roots in the time series.

- **Johansen Test:** To identify the number of cointegrating relationships.

##### **Model Estimation**

- **Determine Optimal Lag Length:** Based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Schwarz Bayesian Criterion (SBC).

- **Estimate VECM Parameters:** Using maximum likelihood estimation.

##### **Diagnostics**

- **Residual Analysis:** Check for autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, and normality.

- **Impulse Response Functions (IRFs):** Assess the impact of shocks over time.

---

#### **2.3. Price Differential Model**

This model examines the price disparities between different markets, considering the influence of conflict intensity and geographic factors.

##### **Regression Models**

- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):**

  \[
  \text{Price Differential}_{ijt} = \alpha + \beta_1 \times \text{Distance}_{ij} + \beta_2 \times \text{Conflict Correlation}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ijt}
  \]

- **Fixed Effects (FE) Model:** Controls for unobserved heterogeneity by incorporating entity-specific effects.

- **Random Effects (RE) Model:** Assumes random variations across entities.

- **Instrumental Variables (IV) Model (IV2SLS):** Addresses potential endogeneity issues.

##### **Diagnostics**

- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** To assess multicollinearity.

- **Breusch-Pagan Test:** For heteroskedasticity.

- **Durbin-Watson Test:** For autocorrelation.

- **Jarque-Bera Test:** For normality of residuals.

- **Ramsey RESET Test:** For model specification.

### **3. Spatial Econometric Analysis**

Spatial econometric techniques are pivotal in understanding the geographical interdependencies and spatial spillover effects in the data.

#### **3.1. Spatial Weights Matrix Construction**

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Constructs spatial weights matrices, dynamically adjusting the number of neighbors to ensure full connectivity.

  \[
  w_{ij} = \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if } j \text{ is one of the k-nearest neighbors of } i \\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \]

- **Connectivity Verification:** Ensures that the spatial weights matrix is fully connected.

#### **3.2. Spatial Lag Models**

- **Spatial Lag of Variables:** Incorporates the influence of neighboring regions into the regression models.

  \[
  \text{Price}_{it} = \rho \sum_{j} w_{ij} \text{Price}_{jt} + X_{it} \beta + \epsilon_{it}
  \]

  Where:
  - \( \rho \) is the spatial autoregressive coefficient.
  - \( w_{ij} \) are spatial weights.

- **Ridge Regression with Spatial Lag:** Mitigates multicollinearity and stabilizes coefficient estimates.

#### **3.3. Spatial Autocorrelation Assessment**

- **Moranâ€™s I:** Detects spatial dependencies in the residuals.

  \[
  I = \frac{N}{\sum_{i} \sum_{j} w_{ij}} \cdot \frac{\sum_{i} \sum_{j} w_{ij}(y_i - \overline{y})(y_j - \overline{y})}{\sum_{i} (y_i - \overline{y})^2}
  \]

  from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor, as_completed
  with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=cpu_count()) as executor:
      futures = [executor.submit(analyze, args) for args in analysis_args]
      for future in as_completed(futures):
          results.append(future.result())
  ```

- **Caching Mechanisms:** Implements caching strategies using `joblib` to optimize repeated data loading and processing steps.
