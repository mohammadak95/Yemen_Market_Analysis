Methodology

The Yemen Market Analysis project employs a comprehensive methodological framework that integrates advanced econometric and spatial analysis techniques to examine the influence of conflict intensity on commodity prices across different regions of Yemen. This section delineates the systematic approach undertaken, encompassing data preprocessing, econometric modeling, spatial analysis, and data preparation for visualization. The methodology leverages robust statistical models, spatial econometric techniques, and parallel processing to ensure rigorous and scalable analyses.

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

1.1. Data Loading

The analysis begins with the acquisition of spatial and temporal data encapsulated in GeoJSON files. The primary dataset, unified_data.geojson, contains detailed records of commodity prices, conflict intensity, and other relevant variables across multiple regions and time periods in Yemen.

	•	Loading Mechanism: Utilizes GeoPandas to read GeoJSON files, ensuring efficient handling of geospatial data.

import geopandas as gpd
gdf = gpd.read_file('unified_data.geojson')


	•	Configuration Management: Employs a YAML configuration file (config.yaml) to manage file paths, directories, and analysis parameters, promoting flexibility and scalability.

1.2. Data Cleaning and Transformation

	•	Duplicate Removal: Eliminates duplicate records to maintain data integrity.

gdf.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)


	•	Missing Values Handling: Addresses missing values through imputation strategies, such as replacing with median values, to prevent skewed analyses.

from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')
gdf['usdprice'] = imputer.fit_transform(gdf[['usdprice']])


	•	Date Processing: Converts date columns to datetime objects to facilitate time-series analyses.

gdf['date'] = pd.to_datetime(gdf['date'], errors='coerce')


	•	Categorical Data Encoding: Transforms categorical variables (e.g., commodity, exchange_rate_regime) into suitable formats for modeling, including the creation of dummy variables.

gdf = pd.get_dummies(gdf, columns=['exchange_rate_regime'], drop_first=True)


	•	Regime Unification: Consolidates specified exchange rate regimes into a unified category (unified) to streamline analyses across different economic conditions.

gdf.loc[gdf['exchange_rate_regime'].isin(['north', 'south']), 'exchange_rate_regime'] = 'unified'



1.3. Data Resampling and Alignment

	•	Frequency Alignment: Resamples the dataset to a consistent temporal frequency (e.g., monthly) to ensure uniformity across time-series analyses.

gdf.set_index('date', inplace=True)
gdf = gdf.groupby('region_id').resample('M').mean().reset_index()


	•	Grouping: Aggregates data by commodity and exchange_rate_regime to facilitate targeted analyses within specific market conditions.
