This paper investigates the nature and degree of market integration and price transmission across staple commodity markets in Yemen, a country affected by protracted conflict, institutional fragmentation, and a dual exchange rate regime. Employing a rigorous econometric and spatial framework, we combine cointegration analysis, vector error correction models (VECMs), spatial econometric specifications, and time-varying market integration indices to examine long-run equilibrium relationships, short-run dynamics, and spatial dependencies in commodity price movements. Our findings offer granular insights into the complex interplay of conflict, market fragmentation, transaction costs, and exchange rate distortions in shaping price formation and integration patterns. The results hold significant implications for policymakers, humanitarian organizations, and international development partners committed to enhancing food security, market efficiency, and economic resilience in Yemen's challenging environment.
