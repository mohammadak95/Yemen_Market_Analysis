\subsection{Market Integration in Developing Countries} 
Market integration is a cornerstone of economic development as it influences resource allocation, price stability, and welfare distribution \citep{fackler2001spatial, ravallion1986testing}. In integrated markets, arbitrage ensures that spatial price differentials remain within bounds defined by transport and transaction costs. Conversely, high transaction costs, infrastructural deficiencies, trade barriers, and information asymmetries can lead to persistent segmentation \citep{dercon1995market, baulch1997transfer}.

Studies in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia illustrate that weak infrastructure, limited market connectivity, and policy-induced distortions impede price transmission and harm food security \citep{mcnew1996spatial, rashid2008spatial}. These findings resonate strongly with Yemen's context, where conflict-related disruptions, poor road infrastructure, and political fragmentation are expected to hamper the smooth functioning of commodity markets.

\citet{fackler2001spatial} present a comprehensive review of spatial price analysis, underscoring the importance of cointegration and vector error correction models (VECMs) in evaluating long-term price relationships between markets. \citet{ravallion1986testing} emphasizes the necessity of testing for market integration, particularly in the context of policy reforms. His analysis highlights how transaction costs operate as a key barrier to market integration, a notion that holds particular relevance for conflict-affected regions like Yemen \citep{mansour2021market}.

\subsection{Price Transmission in Conflict-Affected Regions} 
Conflict imposes severe structural impediments to trade and information flows. Empirical evidence from Ethiopia, Somalia, and Syria underscores that ongoing conflict raises transaction costs, creates localized monopolistic structures, and erodes market integration \citep{dercon1995market, little2007unofficial, mansour2021market}. In Yemen, multiple factions control key trade routes and border crossings, restricting commerce and resulting in localized price spikes. The dual exchange rate regime—where a parallel market rate coexists with an official rate—further distorts price signals, particularly for imported staples \citep{worldbank2022yemen}.

Recent studies of Syria's conflict-affected economy \citep{mansour2021market} illustrate how control of trade routes and border crossings by local actors distorts price signals. In Yemen, a similar dynamic unfolds, as the presence of a dual exchange rate regime introduces further complexities. Exchange rate volatility influences the relative price of imports, contributing to significant price variability across regions with differing degrees of access to foreign currency \citep{worldbank2022yemen}. Such variability poses considerable challenges for price transmission, particularly in regions dependent on imports for essential commodities.

\subsection{Econometric Approaches to Market Integration} 
The assessment of market integration often begins with stationarity tests and cointegration analysis to identify long-run equilibrium relationships \citep{engle1987cointegration, johansen1988statistical}. When cointegration is present, vector error correction models (VECMs) jointly characterize short-term and long-term price dynamics. More recently, spatial econometric models have been introduced to capture geographic patterns of price dependence and to measure how spatial connectivity, or the lack thereof, influences transmission \citep{anselin1988spatial, fackler2001spatial}.

The recognition that market integration can vary over time, responding to shocks, policy changes, or conflict intensity, has driven the use of time-varying integration indices and threshold cointegration techniques \citep{hansen2002testing}. These advanced methodologies allow researchers to capture the dynamic nature of market relationships and identify critical thresholds where market behavior fundamentally changes.

This methodological evolution reflects growing awareness that market integration is not a static condition but rather a dynamic process influenced by various factors including infrastructure quality, institutional capacity, and security conditions. In conflict-affected settings like Yemen, these methodological advances are particularly relevant as they can help identify how specific shocks or policy changes affect market connectivity and price transmission mechanisms.

\subsection{Exchange Rate Unification as a Policy Lever for Market Integration} 
Exchange rate unification is often proposed as a key policy intervention to enhance market integration and economic stability in countries with dual or multiple exchange rate systems \citep{fackler2008estimating, ravallion1986testing}. Unifying exchange rates can streamline price signals, reduce transaction costs, and eliminate arbitrage opportunities that arise from rate differentials \citep{negassa2007estimating}.

In conflict-affected markets, where exchange rate volatility is exacerbated by instability and fragmented control, unifying the exchange rate can mitigate the distortions in price transmission and promote more efficient resource allocation \citep{hansen2002testing}. Studies in other conflict-affected contexts, such as Syria and South Sudan, have demonstrated that exchange rate stabilization and unification can significantly improve market cohesion and economic resilience \citep{mansour2021market}.

For Yemen, exchange rate unification is not merely an economic adjustment but a strategic move towards rebuilding market structures and enhancing food security. By reducing the complexity introduced by dual rates, policymakers can facilitate smoother price adjustments across all markets, thereby fostering greater market integration and reducing regional price disparities.

\subsection{Integrating Spatial and Temporal Dynamics in Market Integration Studies} 
Effective market integration studies, especially in fragmented and conflict-affected environments, require the integration of spatial and temporal dynamics. Spatial econometric techniques, such as Moran’s I statistics and spatial lag models, enable the examination of geographic price dependencies and the influence of neighboring markets on price formation \citep{anselin1988spatial, lesage2009}. Temporal dynamics, captured through VECMs and time-varying integration indices, allow for the analysis of how market relationships evolve in response to shocks and policy interventions \citep{hansen2002testing}.

Combining these approaches provides a comprehensive framework to analyze the multifaceted nature of market integration in Yemen. It facilitates the identification of both spatial linkages and temporal adjustments, offering a nuanced understanding of how markets across different regions interact and respond to economic policies, such as exchange rate unification.

\subsection{Summary and Research Gap} 
While extensive research has examined market integration and price transmission in various developing and conflict-affected countries, there remains a paucity of studies focusing on comprehensive market integration across all regions within a highly fragmented and conflict-ridden country like Yemen. Moreover, the specific role of exchange rate unification in enhancing market cohesion in such settings has not been thoroughly explored.

This study addresses these gaps by employing advanced econometric and spatial methodologies to analyze market integration across all major Yemeni markets, with a particular emphasis on the implications of the dual exchange rate regime. By providing empirical evidence on the dynamics of price transmission and the barriers posed by exchange rate distortions, this research contributes to the formulation of informed policies aimed at unifying exchange rates and fostering broader market integration and economic resilience in Yemen.
